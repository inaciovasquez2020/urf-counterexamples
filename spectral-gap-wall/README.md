Spectral Gap Wall — Minimal Counterexample

Claim Witnessed
Infinite-dimensional or high-rank internal spaces do not bypass operational coercivity when a spectral gap is enforced.

Object
A finite operator family with a strict spectral gap where attempted information amplification fails.

Witness
- Explicit operator specification
- Deterministic check script
- Expected failure mode

Status
Canonical and frozen.
