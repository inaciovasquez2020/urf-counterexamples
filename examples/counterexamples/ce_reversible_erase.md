Counterexample Candidate: Perfect Reversible Erasure

Target Axiom
Irreversibility

Construction
Erase information and later reconstruct it exactly.

Failure Mode
Reconstruction requires hidden state preserving erased bits.

Resolution
Hidden state carries entropy; erasure was not operationally real.
