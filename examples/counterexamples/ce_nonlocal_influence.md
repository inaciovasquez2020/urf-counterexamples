Counterexample Candidate: Instantaneous Global Update

Target Axiom
Locality

Construction
Define a system where a single operation flips all distant states simultaneously.

Failure Mode
Requires infinite signaling speed or pre-shared infinite correlation.

Resolution
Either violates locality bound or reduces to pre-encoded information,
which reintroduces finite-capacity constraints.
