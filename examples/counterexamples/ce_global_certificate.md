Counterexample Candidate: Global Certificate Bypass

Target Invariant
Local Certification Sufficiency

Construction
Assume a single global witness certifies correctness without local checks.

Failure Mode
Verifier must internally reconstruct global state.

Resolution
Verification cost exceeds local capacity; certificate not admissible.
